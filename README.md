# Knowledge Base

Because I want to know everything about everything.

(But I'll start with computers)

## What

This is a single Rust library that will (may) one day contain all sorts of
useful, obscure and downright bizarre facets of computer science and related
subjects. It will grow organically and contain material from as many sources as
I deem possible, based on their suitability.

It's written in Rust because Rust beautifully combines the low level
explicitness required to show how the algorithms work, and the expressiveness to
keep their implementations succinct and intention clear. And `rustdoc` is
amazing. It's the enabler that's underpinning the project.

## Why

Mind expansion.

I have long fantasised about having my own personal encyclopedia of the sum of
my knowledge. I believe that the only way to attain that is to make
knowledge gain a constant companion in life. That means lots of reading. Experts
know best, so they will form the backbone of the source material.

## How

By reading, comprehending, summarising, implementing, testing, and benchmarking
concepts from the following guiding lights:

- Introduction to Algorithms
- The Art of Computer Programming
- Hacker's Delight
- ...
- [more books as I find them]

These are just the books I have acquired. I'm on the hunt for more.

## When

This is a lifelong endeavour, and this repository is just one manifestation of
it.

## Who

You and I, though mostly I. Whilst I'm grateful and happy to accept pull
requests that correct typos, improve formatting, rectify factual
inconsistencies, and the like, new material should come from me. After all, this
is a personal learning experience that I'm making public in case others may find
it useful.
