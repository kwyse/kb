# Knowledge Base

Because I want to know everything about everything.

(But I'll start with computers)

## What

This is a single Rust library that will (may) one day contain all sorts of
useful, obscure and downright bizarre facets of computer science and related
subjects. It will grow organically and contain material from as many sources as
I deem possible, based on their suitability.

It's in Rust because Rust beautifully combines the low level expressiveness
required to see how the algorithms work, and the expressiveness to keep their
implementations succinct and intention clear. And `rustdoc` is amazing. It's the
enabler that's underpinning the project.

## Why

This stuff is *cool*. And I want to learn.

I have long fantasised about having my own personal encyclopedia of the sum of
my knowledge. But my memory is fallible, my experience only sharpest in my
current day-to-day work. Knowledge comes and goes with respect to my needs.

The only way to solidify knowledge is to make it a companion in life. So I shall
read. I'm on the hunt for mythical tomes of computational insight. These will
form the backbone of the source material.

# How

By reading, comprehending, summarising, implementing, testing, and benchmarking
concepts from the following guiding lights:

- Introduction to Algorithms
- The Art of Computer Programming

These are just the books I have acquired copies of. I wish the list steadfast
growth!

# When

This is a lifelong endeavour, and this repository is just one manifestation of
it.
