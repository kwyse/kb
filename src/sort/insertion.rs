//! Insertion sort

//! Sorts elements in O(nÂ²) time. Imagine having a set of cards face down on a
//! table, picking them up in their original unsorted order, and then inserting
//! them into the correct order in hand.

/// The solution presented in CLRS
///
/// This solution matches the one presented in CLRS with one exception: `i` is
/// set to `j` initially, rather than `j - 1`, and the inner loop only executes
/// when `i` if not indexing the first element. This prevents `i` from ever
/// being negative, which causes overflow if `i` is a usize (what it logically
/// should be).
///
/// The outer loop starts from the second element. The inner loop repeatedly
/// shifts elements on its left that are greater than it one space to their
/// right, until the correct position for the key is found. The key is then
/// written in that position.
///
/// Look invariant: at the start of each iteration of the for loop, the slice
/// `arr[0..j]` consists of the elements originally in `arr[0..j]`, but in
/// sorted order. This property must hold for initialization, maintenance and
/// termination.
///
/// Initialization: this is the slice `[0..1]`, a slice of one element, which is
/// sorted
///
/// Maintenance: the for loop moves elements larger than `arr[j]` one space to
/// the right repeatedly until the correct space for `arr[j]` is found, at which
/// point it inserts `arr[j]`, and the slice `arr[0..j]` is sorted
///
/// Termination: upon termination, `j == n`, so the slice `arr[0..j]` is the
/// entire array, which is sorted

/// terminates the inner for loop under the same condition that the CLRS version
